Why Terraform ?
In all the above options we have to only stick to the specific platform but terraform can run on all cloud and any platform. It is not defined only for specific platform. As a DevOps engineer it is difficult to learn different tools just for 1 purpose. Terraform have a universal approach. Terraform can automate infrastruce on any cloud and on-prem enviroment.

Terraform is using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) an human readable language can be written in json or yaml.

Terraform help us to create highly available infrastructure manually it is difficult to create manually.

Terraform uses API as code approach meaning if we want to automate the infra on AWS, terraform will talk to the Aws API's and apply this API's and create infrastructure.
